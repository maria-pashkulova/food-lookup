## About

Users can click on search results to include selected items in a 'Selected foods' table, which aggregates nutritional totals. Additionally, when they click on a food item in the 'Selected foods' table that item gets excluded from the table. What is more, users have the ability to delete a food item, create new food items or edit existing ones by inputting the data into a validated form.
